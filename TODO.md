## TODO

- [x] -dlgo as build flag in docker! (did not improve)
- [ ] Replicate travis env and diff. (not sure how to get the same commit from a new Travis pipeline...)
- [x] `-dlgo` flag


## Ideas
- [ ] Use some attestation for a build (see Trebuchet SolarWinds) for setting env. to replicate
    - Attestations record build steps (?) whereas we extract build info embedded in the executables
